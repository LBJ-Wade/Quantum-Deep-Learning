# Depth Perception using Quantum Deep Learning with Qiskit  
### Team Ube Pancake  
## Objective:  
Recent advances in many fields have accelerated the demand for 3D imaging and 3D reconstruction from very few 2D images/projections. Often, the heart of these techniques require depth perception, which could be implemented with deep learning algorithms (See https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~tinghuiz/projects/SfMLearner/ for an example implementation). In our project, we wish to implement a quantum analog of the classical implementation following the example of Hybrid quantum-classical Neural Networks with PyTorch and Qiskit, an example from the Qiskit Textbook (https://qiskit.org/textbook/ch-machine-learning/machine-learning-qiskit-pytorch.html#quantumlayer).  
## Implementation:  
We hope to closely follow the example of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks from the Qiskit Textbook and extend it to our desired application of depth perception. We plan on training our model based on some labeled and unlabeled images and/or videos with unsupervised learning through PyTorch and Qiskit.  
## Potential Applications:  
There could be many applications for our project such as in virtual reality, 3D game design, autonomous vehicle, 3D modeling/reconstuction, etc.  
## Final Result: 
We hope to train a model that could be readily used for depth perception.  
## Further Development:  
We hope that we can continue to train and improve our model with more data and that our project would eventually be of use for deployment in real-world applications.

*** Note: this is a project for submission in the IBM Qiskit Community SummerJam Quantum Hackathon (North Carolina) ***
